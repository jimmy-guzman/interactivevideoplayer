Interactive Video Player

In this project, I built an HTML5 video player using JavaScript and the HTML5 Video API. Using the supplied mockups, video files, and transcript, I built an interactive video player that synchronizes the video and the transcript. The transcript is placed below the video, and is highlighted as the video progresses. When a user clicks any part of the transcript it takes them to the appropriate place in the video.
